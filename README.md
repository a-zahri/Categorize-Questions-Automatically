# Categorize-Questions-Automatically

The goal is to develop a tag suggestion system for the Stack Overflow site. This will take the form of a machine learning algorithm which will automatically assign several relevant tags to a question.

Apply methods for extracting specific features from textual data.
Implement an unsupervised approach to propose keywords.
Implement a purely supervised approach and compare the results with the unsupervised approach. Several feature extraction methods will be tested and compared; at least :
a bag-of-words approach;
3 approaches to Word/Sentence Embedding: Word2Vec (or Doc2Vec, Gloveâ€¦), BERT and USE.
Establish a specific evaluation method, with separation of the data set for the evaluation.
Use version management software, for example Git, to track changes to the final code to be deployed.
